### Requirements
- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- A Text editor. I will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Exercise Lecture 1 - Flutter - Stateless Applications
This lecture explains how to create and build stateless applications.
It shows how to develop using Dart, the programming language of Flutter and the basic concepts of the framework.
The lecture proposes three simple and small projects, namely [HelloWorld](flutter/helloworld), [Viewer](flutter/viewer) and [Login](flutter/login).
Slides of the lecture can be found [here](Lecture_01.pdf).

### Exercise Lecture 2 - Flutter - Stateful Applications
This lecture explains how to create and build stateful applications.
It shows how to use Stateful widgets, how to manage the state and how the state can be passed between different widgets.
The lecture proposes three small projects, namely [Counter](flutter/counter), [Calculator](flutter/calculator) and [Calculator with Notifier](flutter/calculator_2).
Slides of the lecture can be found [here](Lecture_02.pdf).

### Exercise Lecture 3 - Flutter - Stateful Applications
This lecture explains how to create and build stateful applications.
It reports also examples of unit and widget testing.
The lecture proposes one project, namely [Movies](flutter/movies).
Slides of the lecture can be found [here](Lecture_02.pdf).

### Requirements
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Expo-Cli](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- A Text editor. I will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


### Exercise Lecture 4 - React Native - Stateful Applications
This lecture explains how to create and build stateless and stateful applications.
It shows how to develop using Javascript and React Native, and the basic concepts of the framework.
The lecture proposes two simple and small projects, namely [HelloWorld](react/helloworld) and [Viewer](react/counter).
Slides of the lecture can be found [here](Lecture_04.pdf).
